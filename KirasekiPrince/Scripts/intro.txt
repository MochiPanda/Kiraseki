That was...
I don't think I could describe how amazing that was.
Ah, sorry. Hey there, I'm Lia.
...Sorry, I'm not good at introductions. I like books though. My life is pretty boring, but if I were the protagonist of a novel...
* sigh *
I wish I could live inside a fantasy world.

Hey, it's a shooting star!
That's so pretty. It almost looks like something out of one of those books.
bananya
Wait... why is my bed so lumpy...
AHHH where am I?! What happened to my room? I remember seeing a shooting star...
Oh. What have I gotten myself into...
bananya
Are you ok?
Sorry, I didn't mean to startle you. I'm the local medicine woman, but only in name. I'm really just an old lady.
I haven't seen you around before. Are you a traveller?
(Shoot. Do I look strange?)
I was transported-- err, I mean, I didn't realize where I was going and I just ended up here...
Ah, in that case, welcome to Asteria!
...
... If you're lost, I could take you to the castle.
